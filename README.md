This repository contains a digest of OpenAPI specification documents for the **N**etwork **D**ata **Ex**change 
**(NDEx) REST API** used to communicate with the [NDEx Project](http://www.home.ndexbio.org/index/) public
server and related NDEx private servers. The NDEx Project provides an open-source framework and online database 
commons where scientists can upload, share, and publicly distribute biological networks

OpenAPI is an open, portable and vendor neutral API description standard, and is defined by the Linux 
Foundation [OpenAPI Initiative (OAI)](https://www.openapis.org/) governing body. It is employed worldwide by 
code generation, testing and document creation tools, many of which are listed 
 [here](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/IMPLEMENTATIONS.md).
 
The OpenAPI documents contained in this repository are specifically used in conjunction with the 
[ndextools/openapi-reader](https://github.com/ndextools/openapi-reader) application, so that NDEx developers 
can interactively view and  "try out" NDEx API requests, thus providing them with a low-level API 
and debugging environment as they create language-specific software applications and program libraries.
