This repository contains a digest of OpenAPI specification documents for the **N**etwork **D**ata **Ex**change 
**(NDEx) REST API** used to communicate with the [NDEx Project](http://www.home.ndexbio.org/index/) public

OpenAPI is an open, portable and vendor neutral API description standard, and is defined by the Linux 
Foundation's [OpenAPI Initiative (OAI)](https://www.openapis.org/) governance body. It is employed worldwide by 
code generation, testing and document creation
 [applications and tools](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/IMPLEMENTATIONS.md).
 
 The OpenAPI documents contained in this repositoty are specifically used in conjunction with the
 [ndextools/openapi-reader](https://github.com/ndextools/openapi-reader) application, so that NDEx developers
 can interactively view and  "try out" NDEx API requests, thus providing them with a low-level API 
 and debugging environment as they create language-specific software applications and program libraries.
