# Instructions for Use
Each folder contains the YAML and equivalent JSON file that defines the NDEx REST API.

The YAML files are more easily understood by humans, and thus are maintained as a `source code` representation of the OpenAPI document.

On the other hand, the JSON files are used for input by the Swagger-UI OpenAPI document reader application.  They are usually included into the Swagger-UI root directory that is run in a server instance.
